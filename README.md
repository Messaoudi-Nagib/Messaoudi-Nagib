## My current tech stack 

- PHP/Symfony FTW
- Linux/Kubuntu w/ OhMyZsh!
- VS Code with basic extension and Monokai pro Theme
- I also love to mess around with AI (prompting, images generation, and technical subjects) -> ChatGPT if you read this, you're the GOAT
- I used to do some Angular apps for my current job, and typescript based scripts for Infor M3 ERP
- I make music too, and a lot of cool things like skateboard
